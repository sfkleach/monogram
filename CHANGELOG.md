# Change Log for Monogram

Following the style in https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/


## Unreleased

### Added

- Exponential notation for numbers now added e.g. 1.23e+8

## [0.4.3] Fixed CodeQL Warnings

### Fixed

- [Internal] CodeQL warnings were being generated for GitHub workflows without explicit
  permissions. These have been added.

## [0.4.2] Fixed Docker image

### Fixed

- The Docker image now works correctly with --test. Now the test server 
  permits incoming connections from the host machine. This means that you can
  run the test server in a Docker container and access it from your host machine.

## [0.4.0] Asciitree Format

### Added

- A new output format `asciitree` has been added, suitable for inclusion
  in plain text documents. For example `{ y = x + 1; z = y * y; }` turns into:

```txt
unit
└─ delimited
   │  • kind: braces
   │  • separator: semicolon
   ├─ operator
   │  │  • name: =
   │  │  • syntax: infix
   │  ├─ identifier
   │  │     • name: y
   │  └─ operator
   │     │  • name: +
   │     │  • syntax: infix
   │     ├─ identifier
   │     │     • name: x
   │     └─ number
   │           • value: 1
   └─ operator
      │  • name: =
      │  • syntax: infix
      ├─ identifier
      │     • name: z
      └─ operator
         │  • name: *
         │  • syntax: infix
         ├─ identifier
         │     • name: y
         └─ identifier
               • name: y
```

- A new `install.sh` script that can be used as a quick and dirty way to 
  get monogram installed. Good for CI/CD pipelines.


## [0.3.0] Local Test Server

### Added 

- The new `--test` option runs `monogram` in an exploratory mode, 
  opens a web browser window with a test page.
- New executable `monogram-mini` that is built without the web server 
  for a reduced executable size (12MB -> 3MB).

## [0.2.8.5] More Bug Fixes

### Internal 

- Improved process for bumping version numbers

## [0.2.8] More Bug Fixes

### Fixes

- Fixed incorrect formating and span locations in error messages (#110)
- Fixed loophole around endendXXX identifiers (#111)
- Cleaned up messages in unit-tests.
- `foo!` now marks `foo` as a form-opener. See [decision record](docs/decisions/0014-prefix-forms-introduce-reserved-words/0014-prefix-forms-introduce-reserved-words.md).

## [0.2.7] Bug Fixes

### Fixes

- Inconsistent phrasing in the [README.md](README.md) has been fixed.

- A leading backslash is supposed to introduce an identifer. However this 
  was actually not being recognised as valid syntax. This is now fixed.

```
❯ echo '\_x' | monogram -f xml 
<unit>
  <identifier name="x" />
</unit>
```

- Statements were simple sequences of expressions. This was not intentional
  and the documented grammar is now enforced. This means that the statements 
  of a form are now separated by semi-colons or line breaks.

```
❯ echo 'block a = b * b; x = y + z endblock' | monogram -f xml 
<unit>
  <form syntax="surround">
    <part keyword="block">
      <operator name="=" syntax="infix">
        <identifier name="a" />
        <operator name="*" syntax="infix">
          <identifier name="b" />
          <identifier name="b" />
        </operator>
      </operator>
      <operator name="=" syntax="infix">
        <identifier name="x" />
        <operator name="+" syntax="infix">
          <identifier name="y" />
          <identifier name="z" />
        </operator>
      </operator>
    </part>
  </form>
</unit>

```

Or equivalently

```
❯ cat << "EOF" | ./monogram -f xml
block
    a = b * b
    x = y + z
endblock
EOF
<unit>
  <form syntax="surround">
    ETC ... deleted for brevity. Identical to above.
  </form>
</unit>

```
